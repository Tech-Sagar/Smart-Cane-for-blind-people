# Smart-Stick-for-blind-people
**This project works to  is for the people who are blind and deaf**


The main aim of this research paper is to provide a simple, affordable yet an efficient solution for the visually impaired. The idea behind the design of the stick was to keep it structurally similar i.e. thin, light weight and easy to handle, yet give an active feedback to the user regarding hazards in his walking path. The smart white cane uses the ultrasonicsensors arranged in such a way that it detects knee level obstacles and even those abovethe waist. The user is notified about the same by a haptic feedback in form of vibrations.This can help the user in navigating easily even without the help of other individuals or dogs.Also, this can considerably alleviate the risk of the user injuring 

**The components for the projects are:**
-1.Ultrasonic sensors
-2.Piezo buzzer
-3.Vibrator motor
-4.9 volt battery
-5.Toggle switch
-6.Arduino Uno
